# FreezingSimulations
Freezing simulation files generated using the open source aqueous geochemistry software packages [FREZCHEM](https://github.com/MarcNeveu/frezchem) (v13.3, v15.1) and [PHREEQC](https://www.usgs.gov/software/phreeqc-version-3). The PHREEQC subdirectories contain the associated database files. The frezchem_ColdChem database is constructed from the Pitzer parameters of the ColdChem database and the molar volumes and diffusion coefficients of the frezchem database.

## FREZCHEM\v13.3

### Seawater
Contains the FREZCHEM v13.3 input and output files used to simulate the freezing of seawater. The Pressure subdirectory contains the input and output files used to simulate the freezing of seawater for a range of initial pressures from 1 bar to 500 bars. The Sp_Govern subdirectory contains the input and output files used to simulate the freezing of seawater for a range of initial salinitues from 1 ppt to 250 ppt.
